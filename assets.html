		<h1>6 factors crucial to the<br>
			success of industrial<br>
			IoT in manufacturing</h1>
		<img class="first" src="1.png" alt="">
		<p>As manufacturers digitally transform their value chains,
			connected devices will play a major role.<br> Getting it right
			requires a laser focus on six key areas.
			The internet of things (IoT) connects physical machines and equipment<br> in a factory
			to the digital world of cloud, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It enables
			you to collect more data,<br> analyze the information quickly and make better business
			decisions.</p><br><br><br>
		<p class="second">
			Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they need to bring IT closer to
			operational technologies that control machines and equipment. Traditionally, these
			technologies were managed by separate departments in relative isolation.<br> Leaders,
			such as food and beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a single
			integrated technology function to leverage synergies.
			The next step is to harness technology to optimize the business and drive innovation.
			Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the standard for creating the
			smart factory and supply chain of the future using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics,
			cloud computing and cyber physical systems.<br> Manufacturers can now consider
			business model innovation and new revenue streams as they leverage the deluge of
			IoT data.<br> This is often called the servitization of the industry.<br>
			The importance of Industry 4.0 and the IIoT is well understood, but how do you start
			implementing these concepts to maximize your chances of creating real value?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="factors">
		<h1>Critical success factors</h1>
		<p>There are six critical success factors organizations need to consider to successfully
			use IIoT in their digital transformation initiatives (Figure 1).</p>
		<img src="2.png" alt="">
		<h2>Figure 1. IIoT critical success factors</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="bbenefits">
		<h1>1 Business benefits</h1>
		<p>Early discussions about IIoT primarily focused on the technology and what it could
			do, rather than on the business value IIoT could deliver. This is not surprising; IoT
			technologies’ cool factor has clearly captured people’s attention. More recently, the
			conversations have shifted to the variety of business benefits IIoT can deliver.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="model">
		<h1><img src="bulb.png" alt="">Business model innovation</h1>

		<p>Companies can create new products and
			services to generate additional revenue streams. Machines with IIoT
			sensors can gather huge amounts of data, and advanced analytics
			can transform it into “smart data” – that is, digital information that is
			formatted so that it can be acted upon at the collection point before
			being sent to a downstream analytics platform. Smart data can support
			decision making or can trigger actions automatically, and this value
			can be monetized. One of the most popular use cases is predictive
			maintenance of factory assets. If the organization servicing the assets
			is able to predict equipment failure, it can offer the predictions as an
			additional paid service.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="customerexp">
		<h1><img class="icon" src="person.png" alt="">Customer experience. </h1>
		<p class="quote">“The disruptive potential
			of IoT resides in its
			ability to turn businesses
			inside-out, transform
			products into services,
			transform services into
			learning architectures
			and make us completely
			rethink what the
			organization of the
			future may look like.”
			– John Seely Brown,
			Independent Co-Chairman,
			Deloitte LLP Center for the
			Edge</p>
		<p>IIoT can help make products and services
			more attractive. IIoT-enabled parts, for example, are easier to find in a
			warehouse when used in conjunction with an indoor navigation system
			that can lead warehouse staff directly to their location. A smart product
			can determine when service levels are being exceeded or when it’s time
			for a maintenance check, potentially preventing a breakdown. The data
			generated by smart products also can be used to improve the service
			experience in the after-sales market by learning about customer usage
			and preferences.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="operational">
		<h1><img src="engine.png" alt="">Operational excellence</h1>

		<p>Sensors and actuators can closely monitor
			the manufacturing process and products as they travel through a
			factory, enabling real-time control of the production system. While
			control systems have monitored factories for decades, it is now possible
			to make those systems more intelligent by feeding IIoT and business
			data into smart algorithms. In supply chain operations, sensors and IIoT
			devices can track and trace products on their way from the factory to
			the customer, anywhere in the world.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="environmental">
		<h1> <img src="hand.png" alt=""> Environmental stewardship</h1>

		<p>Traditionally, lower cost and
			higher revenue have been the only measurements of success for
			manufacturers, but today they are also being measured on corporate
			social responsibility. This means that the environmental impact of the
			production process and the products in use are areas of value creation.
			Examples of value include energy savings that result in a lower carbon
			footprint as well as the monitoring of air, soil and water quality. IIoT also
			can help monitor the environment, triggering alerts and even shutting
			down operations if required.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="worker">
		<h1><img src="worker.png" alt=""> Worker health and safety</h1>

		<p>Risks are commonplace. Managing the
			risks effectively avoids the human tragedy and financial loss associated
			with accidents. IIoT sensors can be used to monitor the immediate
			environment around a worker, but can also measure a person’s vitals,
			such as heart rate, fatigue or stress. Knowing where an employee is
			located — together with health data, defined operational limits and data
			analytics — can help detect risks and issues in the work environment.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="compliance">
		<h1><img src="arrow.png" alt=""> Compliance</h1>

		<p>In many cases, manual inspections can be replaced by
			IIoT technologies. For fixed assets in a manufacturing plant, this can
			be achieved through sensors and through autonomous vehicles with
			sensors, cameras, microphones and other technology needed to perform
			inspections. In larger facilities, drones can inspect the outside areas.
			Inspectors responsible for compliance can use IIoT systems to increase
			the inspection frequency and therefore detect compliance issues early
			on.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="strategic">
		<h1>2 Strategic alignment</h1>
		<p class="quote2">
			“The Internet of Things
			will transform business
			processes into IoTenabled
			business
			processes, where things
			and humans collaborate.
			We will witness an
			increased autonomy
			of smart things that
			will be able to navigate
			their own ways
			through our factories,
			distribution centres
			and supply chains,
			analysing contextsensitive
			multiple data
			points to drive highly
			individualised business
			processes.”
			– Michael Rosemann
			Executive Director Corporate
			Engagement, QUT
		</p>
		<p>Some organizations have set up digital innovation labs without clear strategic
			direction or technology roadmaps, and the result is often proofs of concept that don’t
			have value for the business or are not supported by their technology functions.
			For IIoT to have a positive impact on the organization, it needs to be aligned with the
			overall business and technology strategy. The business strategy provides guidance
			on goals and objectives, while the technology strategy identifies constraints around
			technology choices. The best way to ensure strategic alignment is to create an IoT
			strategy that considers current strategies and also drives changes to those strategies.
			For example, if IIoT provides a new way to ensure the health and safety of factory
			workers, the human resources strategy should consider this. Strategic alignment is
			key, but it is not a one-way street.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="process">
		<h1>3 Business process focus</h1>
		<p>The discussion around IIoT is dominated by data analytics, machine learning and
			AI. Business processes may not be the most exciting topic, but they are still the core
			of any organization and define how the business operating model is structured. An
			emerging focus in the manufacturing industry is the integration of IIoT solutions into
			business processes. In an IoT report, McKinsey notes that the missing integration of
			IoT solutions into existing business workflows is a top IoT capability gap.1
			IIoT software vendors may claim their products integrate with business systems, but
			simply passing data to a business system is not the same as creating an end-to-end
			business process. Using that process, organizations will have an increased number
			of smart things in their factory, increased levels of automation and more complex
			supply chains. The expectation is to make everything work together effectively in a
			way that is dramatically better than today.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="operating">
		<h1>4 Operating model changes</h1>
		<p>Many IoT industry participants talk about the convergence of IT and operational
			technology, meaning that the management of business systems and factory
			automation technologies will converge. IT and operational technology convergence
			does not only mean a convergence of technologies, but also that you can optimize
			collaboration between your office floor and your factory floor. In many cases, this will
			lead to changes in the business operating model and will require new capabilities in
			your organization to manage.
			Another aspect is the creation of value networks, which are purpose-built partner
			ecosystems with the customer in the middle. ETH Zurich and Bosch SI developed the
			concept of an “IoT Business Model Builder” that describes how the idea of business
			model innovation as part of Industry 4.0 can be implemented.
			The concept of value networks leads to an extended enterprise and is necessary
			because end-to-end IIoT solutions are even more complex than separate IT and
			operational technology solutions were in the past, and require a very close
			collaboration between the value network stakeholders.</p>
		<p class="quote3">
			“One of the major
			challenges that
			companies face when
			trying to solve for
			revenue generating IoT
			solutions is the fact
			these solutions often
			require disrupting
			the same business
			model that made them
			successful to date.”
			– Tom Galizia, Principal,
			U.S. Technology Strategy
			and Architecture Leader,
			Deloitte Consulting LLP
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="uplift">
		<h1>5 Capability uplift</h1>
		<p>With changes to the technology landscape and operating model, employees need to
			learn new skills as their roles change. It is important that people understand IIoT and
			Industry 4.0 concepts from both a business and technology perspective, establishing
			a common language to minimize the risk of misunderstanding.
			For the next level of detailed understanding of IIoT, focused programs that advance
			employees’ capabilities need to be developed. In these programs, active participation
			of the partner ecosystem, or value network, should be considered. A common
			learning experience can improve and drive day-to-day collaboration.
			Consider how educational and training programs can affect certain roles in a
			manufacturing company and close skills gaps. Chief operating officers can get
			new insights into the operation of the business, but they will want to understand
			what the new data is and how to incorporate it into their decision making. Chief
			technology officers will be flooded with new technologies and will want to select the
			ones relevant for the business. They will want to learn about functionalities provided
			by IIoT gateways, low-power WAN, sensor boards and IoT platforms. Maintenance
			technicians will want to understand why predictive maintenance is important, and
			how IIoT and data analytics will enable them to be more proactive with maintenance
			inspection activities.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="security">
		<h1>6 End-to-end security</h1>
		<p>In the past, manipulating machines in a factory typically required physical access
			to the facility, but by linking assets to the internet and deploying IIoT capabilities,
			facilities are now exposed to new security risks. New approaches for cyber-physical
			systems are being developed that include authentication and encryption capabilities
			built into hardware, real-time analytics of network traffic, and IIoT gateways that
			serve as protective shields for factory equipment, similar to the way firewalls perform
			in IT networks. With the convergence of IT and operational technology, “security by
			design” is becoming a key decision criterion as companies choose technologies.</p>
